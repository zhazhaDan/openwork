# AGENTS.md

OpenWork helps users run agents, skills, and MCP. It is an open-source alternative to Claude Cowork/Codex as a desktop app.

## What OpenWork Is

OpenWork is a practical control surface for agentic work:

* Run local and remote agent workflows from one place.
* Use OpenCode capabilities directly through OpenWork.
* Compose desktop app, server, and messaging connectors without lock-in.
* Treat the OpenWork app as a client of the OpenWork server API surface.
* Connect to hosted workers through a simple user flow: `Add a worker` -> `Connect remote`.

## Core Philosophy

* **Local-first, cloud-ready**: OpenWork runs on your machine in one click and can connect to cloud workflows when needed.
* **Server-consumption first**: the app should consume OpenWork server surfaces (self-hosted or hosted), not invent parallel behavior.
* **Composable**: use the desktop app, WhatsApp/Slack/Telegram connectors, or server mode based on the task.
* **Ejectable**: OpenWork is powered by OpenCode, so anything OpenCode can do is available in OpenWork, even before a dedicated UI exists.
* **Sharing is caring**: start solo, then share quickly; one CLI or desktop command can spin up an instantly shareable instance.

## Core Runtime Model (Updated)

OpenWork now has three production-grade ways to run the same product surface:

1. **Desktop-hosted app/server**
   - OpenWork app runs locally and can host server functionality on-device.
2. **CLI-hosted server (openwork-orchestrator)**
   - OpenWork server surfaces can be provided by the orchestrator/CLI on a trusted machine.
3. **Hosted OpenWork Cloud server**
   - OpenWork-hosted infrastructure provisions workers and exposes the same remote-connect semantics.

User mental model:

* The app is the UI and control layer.
* The server is the execution/control API layer.
* A worker is a remote runtime destination.
* Connecting to a worker happens through `Add worker` -> `Connect remote` using URL + token (or deep link).

Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for runtime flow, server-vs-shell ownership, and architecture behavior. Read `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` for deployment and control-plane details.

## Why OpenWork Exists

**Cowork is closed-source and locked to Claude Max.** We need an open alternative.
**Mobile-first matters.** People want to run tasks from their phones, including via messaging surfaces like WhatsApp and Telegram through OpenCode Router.
**Slick UI is non-negotiable.** The experience must feel premium, not utilitarian.

## Agent Guidelines for development

* **Purpose-first UI**: prioritize clarity, safety, and approachability for non-technical users.
* **Parity with OpenCode**: anything the UI can do must map cleanly to OpenCode tools.
* **Prefer OpenCode primitives**: represent concepts using OpenCode's native surfaces first (folders/projects, `.opencode`, `opencode.json`, skills, plugins) before introducing new abstractions.
* **Web parity**: anything that mutates `.opencode/` should be expressible via the OpenWork server API; Tauri-only filesystem calls are a fallback for host mode, not a separate capability set.
* **Self-referential**: maintain a gitignored mirror of OpenCode at `vendor/opencode` for inspection.
* **Self-building**: prefer prompts, skills, and composable primitives over bespoke logic.
* **Open source**: keep the repo portable; no secrets committed.
* **Slick and fluid**: 60fps animations, micro-interactions, premium feel.
* **Mobile-native**: touch targets, gestures, and layouts optimized for small screens.

## Task Intake (Required)

Before making changes, explicitly confirm the target repository in your first task update.

Required format:

1. `Target repo: <path>` (for example: `_repos/openwork`)
2. `Out of scope repos: <list>` (for example: `_repos/opencode`)
3. `Planned output: <what will be changed/tested>`

If the user request references multiple repos and the intended edit location is ambiguous, stop after discovery and ask for a single repo target before editing files.

## New Feature Workflow (Required)

When the user asks to create a new feature, follow this exact procedure:

1. Make sure you are up to date on all submodules and repos synced to the head of remotes.
2. Create a worktree.
3. Implement the feature.
4. Start the OpenWork dev stack via Docker (from the OpenWork repo root): `packaging/docker/dev-up.sh`.
5. Use Chrome MCP to fully test the feature: `.opencode/skills/openwork-docker-chrome-mcp/SKILL.md`.
6. Take screenshots and put them in the repo.
7. Refer to these screenshots in the PR (only if relevant in the UI).
8. Always test the flow you just implemented.

If you cannot complete steps 4-8 (Docker, Chrome MCP, missing credentials, or environment limitations), you must say so explicitly and include:

* which steps you could not run and why
* what you verified instead (tests, logs, manual checks)
* the exact commands/steps the user should run to complete the end-to-end gate

## Pull Request Expectations (Fast Merge)

If you open a PR, you must run tests and report what you ran (commands + result).

To maximize merge speed, include evidence of the end-to-end flow:

* Ideally: attach a short video/screen recording showing the flow running successfully.
* Otherwise: screenshots are acceptable, but video is preferred.

If you cannot run tests or capture the video, say so explicitly and explain why, and include the exact commands/steps for the reviewer to reproduce.

## Living Systems

OpenWork aims to be a **living system**: agents, skills, commands, and config are hot-reloadable while sessions are running. This enables agents to create new skills or update their own configuration and have changes take effect immediately, without tearing down active sessions.

Design principles for hot reload:

* **Conservative triggers**: only reload when a file that OpenCode reads at startup actually changes inside `.opencode/` or `opencode.json`. Ignore metadata files like `openwork.json`, `.DS_Store`, etc.
* **Workspace-scoped**: reload state is keyed per workspace. Switching workspaces never leaks reload signals from one workspace to another.
* **Session-aware**: when sessions are actively running, queue reload signals. Promote to visible reload (toast or auto-reload) only after all active sessions finish. This avoids interrupting in-flight tool calls.
* **Auto-reload setting**: each workspace can opt into automatic reload via `.opencode/openwork.json` (`reload.auto`). When enabled, the engine reloads automatically once queued signals are ready and no sessions are active.
* **Session continuity**: before reload, capture running session IDs, agents, and models. After reload, optionally relaunch those sessions so the user experiences seamless continuity.
* **Per-workspace isolation**: the desktop file watcher only watches the runtime-connected workspace root and its `.opencode/` directory. This can differ briefly from the UI-selected workspace while the user browses another workspace. The server reload event store is already keyed by `workspaceId`.

## Technology Stack

| Layer                | Technology                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Desktop/Mobile shell | Tauri 2.x with Electron migration path |
| Frontend             | SolidJS + TailwindCSS     |
| State                | Solid stores + IndexedDB  |
| IPC                  | Tauri commands + events   |
| OpenCode integration | Spawn CLI or embed binary |

## Repository Guidance

* Use `VISION.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` to understand the "why" and requirements so you can guide your decisions.
* Treat `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the authoritative system design source for runtime flow, server ownership, filesystem mutation policy, and agent/runtime boundaries. If those behaviors change, update `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same task.
* Use `DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md` as the default visual reference for OpenWork app and landing work.
* For OpenWork session-surface details, also reference `packages/docs/orbita-layout-style.mdx`.

## App Architecture (CUPID)

For `apps/app/src/app/**`, use CUPID: small public surfaces, intention-revealing names, minimal dependencies, predictable ownership, and domain-based structure.

* Organize app code by product domain and app behavior, not generic buckets like `pages`, `hooks`, `utils`, or app-wide props.
* Prefer a thin shell, domain modules, and tiny shared primitives.
* Colocate state, UI, helpers, and server/client adapters with the domain that owns the workflow.
* Treat shared utilities as a last resort; promote only after multiple real consumers exist.
* Cross-domain imports should go through a small public API, not another domain's internals.
* Keep global shell code thin and use it for routing, top-level layout, runtime wiring, and shared reload/update surfaces only.
* Domain map: shell, workspace, session, connections, cloud, app-settings, and kernel.
* When changing app architecture, moving ownership, or editing hot spots like `app.tsx`, `pages/dashboard.tsx`, `pages/session.tsx`, or `pages/settings.tsx`, consult the workspace-root skill at `../../.opencode/skills/cupid-app-architecture/SKILL.md` first.

## Dev Debugging

* If you change `apps/server/src`, rebuild the OpenWork server binary (`pnpm --filter openwork-server build:bin`) because `openwork` (openwork-orchestrator) runs the compiled server, not the TS sources.

## OpenCode SDK Usage

OpenWork integrates with OpenCode via:

1.  **Non-interactive mode**: `opencode -p "prompt" -f json -q`
2.  **Database access**: Read `.opencode/opencode.db` for sessions and messages.

Key primitives to expose:

* `session.Service` — Task runs, history
* `message.Service` — Chat bubbles, tool calls
* `agent.Service` — Task execution, progress
* `permission.Service` — Permission prompts
* `tools.BaseTool` — Step-level actions

## Safety + Accessibility

* Default to least-privilege permissions and explicit user approvals.
* Provide transparent status, progress, and reasoning at every step.
* WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
* Screen reader labels for all interactive elements.

## Performance Targets

| Metric                 | Target         |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| First contentful paint | <500ms         |
| Time to interactive    | <1s            |
| Animation frame rate   | 60fps          |
| Interaction latency    | <100ms         |
| Bundle size (JS)       | <200KB gzipped |

## Skill: SolidJS Patterns

When editing SolidJS UI (`apps/app/src/**/*.tsx`), consult:

* `.opencode/skills/solidjs-patterns/SKILL.md`

This captures OpenWork’s preferred reactivity + UI state patterns (avoid global `busy()` deadlocks; use scoped async state).

## Skill: Trigger a Release

OpenWork releases are built by GitHub Actions (`Release App`). A release is triggered by pushing a `v*` tag (e.g. `v0.1.6`).
`Release App` can also publish openwork-orchestrator sidecars and npm packages when enabled via workflow inputs or repo vars (`RELEASE_PUBLISH_SIDECARS`, `RELEASE_PUBLISH_NPM`).

### Standard release (recommended)

1.  Ensure `main` is green and up to date.
2.  Bump versions (keep these in sync):

* `apps/app/package.json` (`version`)
* `apps/desktop/package.json` (`version`)
* `apps/orchestrator/package.json` (`version`, publishes as `openwork-orchestrator`)
* `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (`version`)
* `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (`version`)

You can bump all three non-interactively with:

* `pnpm bump:patch`
* `pnpm bump:minor`
* `pnpm bump:major`
* `pnpm bump:set -- 0.1.21`

3.  Merge the version bump to `main`.
4.  Create and push a tag:
    * `git tag vX.Y.Z`
    * `git push origin vX.Y.Z`

This triggers the workflow automatically (`on: push.tags: v*`).

### Re-run / repair an existing release

If the workflow needs to be re-run for an existing tag (e.g. notarization retry), use workflow dispatch:

* `gh workflow run "Release App" --repo different-ai/openwork -f tag=vX.Y.Z`

### Verify

* Runs: `gh run list --repo different-ai/openwork --workflow "Release App" --limit 5`
* Release: `gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo different-ai/openwork`

Confirm the DMG assets are attached and versioned correctly.

## Skill: Publish openwork-orchestrator (npm)

This is usually covered by `Release App` when `publish_sidecars` + `publish_npm` are enabled. Use `.opencode/skills/openwork-orchestrator-npm-publish/SKILL.md` for manual recovery or one-off publishing.

1.  Ensure the default branch is up to date and clean.
2.  Bump `apps/orchestrator/package.json` (`version`).
3.  Commit the bump.
4.  Build and upload sidecar assets for the same version tag:
    * `pnpm --filter openwork-orchestrator build:sidecars`
    * `gh release create openwork-orchestrator-vX.Y.Z apps/orchestrator/dist/sidecars/* --repo different-ai/openwork`
5.  Publish:
    * `pnpm --filter openwork-orchestrator publish --access public`
6.  Verify:
    * `npm view openwork-orchestrator version`
