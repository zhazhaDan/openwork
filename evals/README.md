# OpenWork UI evals

Human-readable scenarios that an LLM (or a person) can replay against a live
OpenWork instance to verify end-to-end behavior of the UI.

Each eval is:
- A short list of steps written in plain English.
- An **expected outcome** with observable signals.
- The most useful Chrome DevTools MCP calls to drive it.

They are not unit tests. They intentionally exercise the running stack
(OpenCode + OpenWork server + React UI) so regressions in wiring — not just
types — get caught.

## How to run

1. Start the narrowest supported local app/server stack for the flow under test.
   Use its web URL and avoid hard-coding default ports unless that stack documents them.

2. Pick a runner:
   - **Chrome DevTools MCP** (recommended). The tool names referenced in each
     flow are the `chrome-devtools_*` tools from the Chrome DevTools MCP
     server. Open the printed web URL in a fresh page via
     `chrome-devtools_new_page` and drive from there.
   - **Manual browser** — open the URL and follow the step lists by hand.

3. Walk each eval top-to-bottom. Only mark ✅ when every expected signal is
   visible. Capture a screenshot with `chrome-devtools_take_screenshot` if you
   want evidence.

4. Stop the stack using the teardown command for the stack you started.

## Conventions

- Selectors in the steps are descriptive, not CSS. Resolve them via
  `chrome-devtools_take_snapshot` and click by `uid`.
- When asked to "wait for X", use `chrome-devtools_wait_for` with the exact
  visible text. Keep the text short and unique.
- If a step expects a connected provider and the stack shows none, note it
  as an environment limitation, not an eval failure.
